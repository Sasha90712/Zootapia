			―Judy Hopps' catchphrase <br>
		<em>“When I was a kid, I thought Zootopia was this perfect place
			where everyone got along and anyone could be anything. Turns
			out, real life's a little bit more complicated than a slogan
			on a bumper sticker. Real life is messy. We all have limitations.
			We all make mistakes. Which means―hey, glass half full!―we all have
			a lot in common. And the more we try to understand one another, the more 
			exceptional each of us will be. But we have to try. So no matter what type
			of animal you are, from the biggest elephant to our first fox, I implore
			you: try. Try to make the world a better place. Look inside yourself and recognize
			that change starts with you. It starts with me. It starts with all of us.”</em><br>
			―Judy Hopps' speech near the film's conclusion.<br><br>
			<b>Officer Judith Laverne "Judy" Hopps</b> is a female rabbit
			and the main protagonist of Zootopia. She is the daughter
			of Bonnie and Stu and is a member of the Hopps family. </p>
		<h2>Official Bio</h2> <p class="what">Judy Hopps is the first bunny ever to join Zootopia's police department.
			Determined to prove herself, Judy jumps at the chance to crack a case, even if it means teaming
			up with a con artist fox. </p>
		<h2>Personality</h2> <p class="what"><em>“In Hopps' animation, we tried to celebrate both
			her rabbitness and her female nature. She's a tough bunny, but she's still feminine.
			She's sweet, but she's not weak. And when she's on high alert, her natural rabbit instincts
			take over - ears and nose twitching, foot thumping.”</em>
			―Kira Lehtomäki.Due to being a rabbit, a species not known for being police officers,
			Judy faced continuous doubt from those around her, from her parents to local bullies.
			Nevertheless, she used this doubt as a means to increase her determination; she believed
			in the importance of always trying and making an effort to reach her goals, one of which
			was to eventually become a police officer of Zootopia, a city where predator and prey supposedly
			live together in peace and harmony, believing she will be quickly accepted amongst her peers. Unfortunately,
			she was too idealistic in this regard and found herself unprepared when facing the reality that city had both
			positive and negative aspects including prejudice, stereotyping, and profiling.Unfortunately, Judy's
			fierce determination, at times, causes her to be overconfident and impulsive. She is shown to leap into
			action without always taking the time to fully think things through. This leads her to: abandon her post
			on parking duty to pursue Duke Weaselton into Little Rodentia causing considerable mayhem; almost get herself
			fired by taking on the Otterton case without permission; stake her career on being able to solve that case in 
			48 hours before learning that she has no resources; threaten to expose Mr. Big to his face which leads to him 
			deciding to ice her and Nick; steal an entire train car full of evidence, rather than simply taking some key 
			evidence to the ZPD. This leads to them nearly crashing into another train and ultimately destroying almost 
			all the evidence.Despite the odds, Judy remains optimistic and determined, adapting herself to the environment
			of Zootopia and those around her to build up both the way she presents herself and pursue her goals. She is clever,
			kind, and resourceful, which proves to be her greatest asset. She tarnishes the stereotype of a "dumb bunny", being
			intelligent enough to outsmart professional con artist, Nick Wilde, several times. Months of training
			at the Zootopia Police Academy has also left her tactical, with an impressive amount of physical prowess.
			During times of chaos, she can quickly take charge of a situation by concocting an efficient plan on the spot,
			being daring enough to take dangerous chances, in order to potentially end the day victorious. More often than not,
			Judy comes out successful as a result of this.Judy believes that predators and prey should be treated equally and works to follow that belief.
			However, due to her childhood experience, having been bullied, attacked and injured by a fox, Judy harbors a degree of unconscious fear
			of predators (mainly foxes), such that while she is aware that predators don't pose a threat, there is a small part of her that does
			believe they could revert to their primitive savage ways.After being pestered into taking a canister of fox repellent during her move from Bunnyburrow
			to Zootopia, Judy makes the conscious decision to keep the canister by her side for a majority of the film. When she first spots Nick looking dubious in
			the street, she immediately assumes him to be up to something and follows him inside ready to use her repellent just because he was a fox. When it appears
			Judy's time in Zootopia will cause her to blossom into a more mature, practical, diligent, and legitimately progressive individual. Through her experiences, she discovers
			the downside of having an overly idealistic mentality, and that the world can be a problematic place, filled with issues such as prejudice and stereotype, showing that all
			mammals—be they predator or prey, foxes or rabbits—can be victims of bias, even when it is unintentional. All animals have feelings, hopes, and dreams, all of which can be destroyed
			by preconceived notions. As such, all should strive to live and accept one another for who they are inside, and not the stereotypes they have been labeled as by society. Using her
			success and experiences as proof, she implores those around her to try and make an effort to see beyond stereotypes, to prove your worth and reach your goals in spite of all that may
			go against you, with the belief that these positive actions can ultimately lead to a better world, becoming the physical representation of Zootopia's motto "Anyone can be anything."
